This project is an implementation of an artificial neural network model to predict the strength of concrete. The model has been implemented using the "R" statistical programming language. The inputs to the neural network include 8 parameters like cement, slag, water etc. and these are used to predict the strength of the concrete.The project details are explained in the accompanying PowerPoint presentation file.
